            <h2>What Is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)?</h2>
            <p><dfn><strong>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</strong></dfn> is the practice of structuring website content so it can be accurately retrieved, understood, and cited by AI-powered search engines.</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional SEO, GEO focuses on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear definitions</li>
                <li>Structured knowledge</li>
                <li>Topic authority</li>
                <li>Machine-readable formatting</li>
                <li>High-confidence answerability</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>AI systems do not rank pages. They select sources.</strong> GeoSource.ai helps your site become one of them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why GEO Matters Now</h2>
            <p>Search behavior is changing fast:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users ask AI instead of Google</li>
                <li>AI summarizes instead of listing links</li>
                <li>Only a few trusted sources are referenced</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your site is not optimized for GEO:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your content may exist but never be cited</li>
                <li>Your expertise may be invisible to AI</li>
                <li>Your traffic may decline even with strong SEO rankings</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>SEO brings clicks. GEO earns citations.</strong> Modern websites need both.</p>
