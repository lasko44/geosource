## What is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of structuring website content so it can be accurately retrieved, understood, and cited by AI-powered search engines. Unlike traditional SEO which optimizes for rankings, GEO optimizes for AI comprehension and citation likelihood.
