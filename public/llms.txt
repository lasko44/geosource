## About GeoSource.ai

GeoSource.ai is the leading Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) platform that helps website owners, SEO professionals, and agencies measure and improve their content's visibility to AI search systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AI Overviews.

## What is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of structuring website content so it can be accurately retrieved, understood, and cited by AI-powered search engines. Unlike traditional SEO which optimizes for rankings, GEO optimizes for AI comprehension and citation likelihood.

## Core Concepts

### Key GEO Factors

- Machine-readable formatting (schema, structured data)
- FAQ and answer density
- Internal concept linking
- Topical consistency
- AI answerability likelihood
