## What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing website content so AI systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini can clearly understand, trust, and reference it when generating answers.

GEO focuses on:
- Structure and definitions
- Answerability
- Authority signals
- Machine readability
- Citation quality

## How is GEO Different from SEO?

SEO focuses on ranking pages in traditional search engine results.
GEO focuses on whether AI models can confidently summarize, cite, or reference your content inside generated responses.

A page can rank well in Google but still be invisible to AI systems.

| SEO | GEO |
|-----|-----|
| Helps users find your page | Helps AI systems use your page |
| Optimizes for rankings | Optimizes for answer clarity |
| Targets keywords | Targets semantic structure |
| Measures backlinks | Measures citation confidence |

Modern search strategies require both SEO and GEO.

## What is a GEO Score?

A GEO score is a numerical rating from 0 to 100 that measures how optimized a webpage is for AI search engines. GeoSource.ai's GEO score tool calculates this using 12 AI evaluation pillars.

### GEO Score Letter Grades
- A+ (90%+): Excellent AI visibility
- A/A- (80-89%): Very good AI visibility
- B+/B/B- (65-79%): Good AI visibility
- C+/C/C- (50-64%): Needs improvement
- D or below: Poor AI visibility

### The 12 GEO Evaluation Pillars

1. **Definition Clarity** - How well content defines key terms and concepts
2. **Content Structure** - Heading hierarchy and content organization
3. **Topic Authority** - Content depth, comprehensiveness, and expertise signals
4. **Machine Readability** - Technical accessibility for AI crawlers (schema markup, semantic HTML)
5. **Answerability** - How easily AI can extract direct answers
6. **E-E-A-T Signals** - Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness
7. **Citation Quality** - Quality and quantity of references to authoritative sources
8. **AI Accessibility** - Whether AI crawlers can access and index content
9. **Content Freshness** - How current and up-to-date content appears
10. **Readability** - Reading level and sentence complexity
11. **Question Coverage** - Whether content answers common questions about the topic
