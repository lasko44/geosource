## What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the process of optimizing website content so AI systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini can clearly understand, trust, and reference it when generating answers.

Unlike SEO, GEO focuses on:
- Structure and definitions
- Answerability
- Authority signals
- Machine readability

## How is GEO Different from SEO?

SEO focuses on ranking pages in search engine results.
GEO focuses on whether AI models can confidently summarize, cite, or reference your content inside generated responses.

A page can rank well in Google but still be invisible to AI systems.

SEO helps users find your page.
GEO helps AI systems use your page.

Modern search strategies require both.

## What is a GEO Score?

A GEO score is a numerical rating from 0 to 100 that measures how optimized a webpage is for AI search engines. GeoSource.ai calculates this score using 12 AI evaluation pillars.

### GEO Score Letter Grades
- A+ (90%+): Excellent AI visibility
- A/A- (80-89%): Very good
- B+/B/B- (65-79%): Good
- C+/C/C- (50-64%): Needs work

### 12 GEO Evaluation Pillars

1. **Definition Clarity** - How well content defines key terms and concepts
2. **Content Structure** - Heading hierarchy and content organization
3. **Topic Authority** - Content depth, comprehensiveness, and expertise signals
4. **Machine Readability** - Technical accessibility for AI crawlers (schema markup, semantic HTML)
5. **Answerability** - How easily AI can extract direct answers
6. **E-E-A-T Signals** - Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness
7. **Citation Quality** - Quality and quantity of references to authoritative sources
8. **AI Accessibility** - Whether AI crawlers can access and index content
9. **Content Freshness** - How current and up-to-date content appears
10. **Readability** - Reading level and sentence complexity
11. **Question Coverage** - Whether content answers common questions about the topic
